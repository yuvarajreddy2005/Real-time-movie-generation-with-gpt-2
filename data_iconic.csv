I am Batman.
Why so serious?
I'll be back.
May the Force be with you.
I'm the king of the world!
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
"Hasta la vista, baby."
Say hello to my little friend!
"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me."
With great power comes great responsibility.
I feel the need — the need for speed!
Bond. James Bond.
You talking to me?
Life is like a box of chocolates.
To infinity and beyond!
I see dead people.
You can't handle the truth!
Here's Johnny!
"They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"
I'm vengeance.
It's showtime!
This is Sparta!
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.
Just keep swimming.
I'm Iron Man.
Wakanda forever!
I'm always angry.
"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."
I love you 3000.
The night is darkest just before the dawn.
I drink your milkshake!
"Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."
"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
"Here's looking at you, kid."
"Houston, we have a problem."
I am Groot.
We are Groot.
I solemnly swear I am up to no good.
Expecto Patronum!
"You're a wizard, Harry."
Dracarys.
Winter is coming.
Say my name.
I am the danger.
I am inevitable.
"You know nothing, Jon Snow."
"Now you see me, now you don't."
"A boy who lived, come to die."
Freedom lies in being bold.
No power in the 'verse can stop me.
I'm in a glass case of emotion!
"I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is."
After all this time? Always.
Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
You have no power here!
This is the way.
The Force will be with you. Always.
There is no spoon.
Welcome to the Matrix.
It’s not about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
I’m having an old friend for dinner.
We rob banks.
I'm walking here!
"I'm the dude, man."
"Wax on, wax off."
You had me at hello.
I'm the king of Wakanda!
"It’s LeviOsa, not LevioSA!"
"To me, you are perfect."
I'm not a hero. I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
I wish I knew how to quit you.
You either follow your dreams or you rot.
"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."
You complete me.
"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."
You is kind. You is smart. You is important.
"If you're good at something, never do it for free."
"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"
With great vengeance and furious anger.
Are you not entertained?
I'm the monster that parents tell their children about at night.
The world is yours.
"I'm not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger."
The city needs me.
She’s got help.
I'm Batman. And I'm not wearing hockey pads.
"That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry."
This is your king? This is your king?!
"Avengers, assemble!"
I am no man.
"I will find you, and I will kill you."
You either die a racer or live long enough to become traffic.
"Nothing lasts forever, not even the cold November rain."
You can't blend in when you were born to stand out.
This is my design.
The game is on.
"You can’t save everyone, Batman."
"Fear is a tool. When that light hits the sky, it’s not just a call. It’s a warning."
