- Clean, formatted, and aesthetic dialogue outputs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2)
- PyTorch
- Datasets Library
- Google Colab

## 💡 How It Works:
1. **Custom Dataset:** A curated CSV file of iconic dialogues was preprocessed and augmented.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** GPT-2 was fine-tuned using Hugging Face Trainer API with tokenized data.
3. **Generation:** Once trained, the model generates movie-style dialogue lines based on user prompts.
4. **Optional Extensions:** Emoji addition, voice output, and text cleaning were explored.

## 🚀 Example Outputs:
```
🎬 Prompt: I'm Batman
🗣️ AI Dialogue: I'm Batman... the only one who stands between fear and chaos. 🦇
